      "book_description": "Do You Struggle with Distance Control When Putting?Are You Tired of 3 Putting?McDonald’s Founder Ray Kroc was asked what it felt like to be an Overnight Success. His answer was profound: “I was an Overnight Success all right, but 30 Years is a long, long night.”. My Long, Long Night is 37 years in the making, but this is a Simple Decision for YOURSELF.. Purchase this book, and if by chance you don’t like to read, go Directly to the 5 Drills that were designed and created around my Method and YOU WILL Lower Your Putting Stroke Average.. The putting subjects covered in this book are Distance Control (The first step towards becoming a Master Putter), Grip & Alignment, Ball Position, my Body-Part to Body-Part Technique (designed to develop a smooth physical putting stroke), and a complete INNOVATIVE, Simplified, Revision on how to Read Greens based on my Putting Method.. From a Pure Beginner/Novice Golfer to the Tour Pro Putt Two Par will Teach YOU -HOW TO TEACH YOURSELF- and UNLOCK your Golfing Brain.. ***. Ben was raised as an athlete in his hometown of Joliet, Illinois, by his father, and excelled as a football and baseball player for his high school and college Hall of Fame Coach, Gordie Gillespie.. In 1984, at the age of 26, after his Military Service was completed, Ben began his golf studies in Heidelberg, Germany. Then, in 1987, his teaching career began in Germany, where a majority of his students were Pure Beginners.. It was in this Golfing Infant Community that Ben began experimenting with a Consistent Method and credits that experience as his breakthrough in what would become The Mutz Method of Golf Instruction.. In Downtown Chicago, in the early 90s, he founded The Ben Mutz Golf Academy and received Tour Manufacture Credentials that helped launch one of the first Enlarged Putter Grips on the PGA Tour. He also hosted a TV show called Modern Golf with Ben Mutz.. Putt Two Par is the first in a series of four books that will cover Ben’s entire FOUNDATIONAL Method of Golf Instruction.**Ben’s Method Teaches Students How to Teach Themselves with the #1 Goal of UNLOCKING Their Golfing Brain!**",

          "body": "This instructional book offers a quantitative, objective approach to what most golfers trust to “feel” …. distance control when putting. In it, Mr. Mutz describes how to set the length of the putting stroke based on pacing off the putt distance, producing a number which is then translated into a “body part to body part” stroke length. The number, and hence the stroke length, is increased/decreased to account for up/down slope changes along the length of the putt. He also offers a method for dealing with the left/right break of the putt by visualizing the point at which the putt will drop towards the hole and straight line-aiming at that target point. His method for producing the correct tempo is also discussed. The book ends with a series of drills to reinforce the method. I’ve been using Mr. Mutz’s putting method for several years now with a good deal of success (which, of course, is all relative in this game). While it sounds fairly complicated at first, after a while it becomes quite streamlined and second nature. As for the book itself, it reads as if Mr. Mutz is in front of you conducting training sessions. His enthusiasm and passion come through clearly and the many photos are quite useful. The book is a bit lengthy and there is a lot of repetition – all in hopes of driving home his method. I am an avid golfer generally shotting in the 90’s. But I average 2 putts per hole. When I stand over a putt, I feel confident that I can get it close – and confidence is quite important as we all know! In all, Mr. Mutz has much to offer golfers at every level.Read more",
